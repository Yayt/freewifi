    <string name="abouttext">The Free Wifi app was developed by six future-oriented guys in 2015. The Team was founded during the “Application development project” at Helsinki Metropolia University of applied sciences. As we experience problems connecting to the internet without mobile data by ourselves, we wanted to help people with the same problem. That was the fundamental idea of this app.</string>
